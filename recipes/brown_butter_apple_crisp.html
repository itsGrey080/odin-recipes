        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Brown butter adds a new twist to these bars with a rich caramel flavor from brown sugar and vanilla. Rolled oats make them hearty enough for breakfast. We won't judge.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 large Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons firmly packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups rolled oats</li>
                <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Reserve 3/4 cup of apple pie filling and set aside. Spoon remaining pie filling into crust.</li>
                <li>Combine cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl; beat until smooth. Add eggs and mix well; pour over apple filling in crust.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are puffed and surface of cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven and cool to room temperature.</li>
                <li>To make the caramel apple topping: Mix reserved apple filling and caramel sauce in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until warmed through, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Arrange apple slices around outside edge of cooled cheesecake. Spread caramel sauce evenly on top; decorate with pecan halves around edge. Sprinkle with chopped pecans. Chill until ready to serve.</li>
